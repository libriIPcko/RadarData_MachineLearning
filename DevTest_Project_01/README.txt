DEVTEST_Project


Contain SVM_Anomaly testing of parameters changes:
	SVM_anomalyDetection_vNUanalysis.py
	SVM_anomalyDetection_vPolyAnalysis.py
	SVM_anomalyDetection_vUniversalAnalysis.py
	
With graphical and video output to the appropriate folder. 
The folders are included in the DEVTES_Project as:
	SVM_an_v0
	SVM_an_vGammaAnalysis
	SVM_an_vNUanalysis
	SVM_an_vPolyAnalysis
	
	
The folders with figure word contained in the name are saved old outputs from above mentioned skripts.
PartialModulesOfSourceCode folder contains separated modules, which are used for implementation to the
script mentioned above.

Bordel, you do not want know What is there :D
	What ? Really? Well your request My Duty. In that folders are saved broken pieces of code and 
generated video outputs from parameter testing of ML algorithms. Actually, maybe it is deleted. I believe in that...
